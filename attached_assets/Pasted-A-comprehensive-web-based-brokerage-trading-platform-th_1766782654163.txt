A comprehensive web-based brokerage trading platform that enables users to trade cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and ETFs with real-time market data integration from multiple financial data providers (CoinGecko, AlphaVantage, Massive.         com, TwelveData, FinancialModelingPrep, EODHD) via their APIs. The platform features user authentication through Google OAuth, Facebook OAuth, or manual registration (email, phone, password, country) with automated welcome emails. Users can view and manage their portfolio through an intuitive dashboard displaying balance, total profits, today's profits, and profile information. The trading interface includes a central chart area with a left sidebar menu for portfolio management, trade history, education, and chat support, plus a right panel for trade execution (timing, investment amount, profit margin, buy/sell buttons). An admin panel allows toggling API providers on/off. The platform supports multi-market asset selection through animated popups showing available assets per market category.

Note: The application will be built using React with a Node.js/Express backend.

Core Features:

- User authentication system with Google/Facebook OAuth and manual registration with welcome email notifications

Visual References:

Inspired by Robinhood, Coinbase Pro, and Apple's design language, combining sleek financial interfaces with iOS-style smooth interactions and glassmorphism effects.   (For the UI, I have attached an image from IQ Options so you can use it for reference on how the user dashboard will look. I also want you to make the design responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop.)
